üìù Project Summary
This project involves an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Titanic dataset using Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

 What‚Äôs Done :-
Loaded and explored the Titanic dataset (train.csv).

Checked data types, column names, and missing values using info() and describe().

Analyzed categorical data like gender distribution (Sex column).

Converted categorical gender data into numeric format for analysis.

Created pair plots to visualize relationships between features like Age, Fare, and Survival status.

Generated a correlation heatmap to understand the relationships between numerical features.

Plotted histograms of Age, Fare, and Survival to understand their distribution.

Used boxplots to compare distributions of Age and Fare based on survival.

Created a scatter plot to explore the relationship between Age and Fare, colored by survival.

These visualizations help in understanding the key factors that might have influenced a passenger‚Äôs survival on the Titanic.
